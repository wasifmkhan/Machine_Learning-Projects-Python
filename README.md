# Various-ML-Projects
Here I will add machine learning projects and I do on the side in Python. Each file will have its own description.

1. [Linear Regression to predict housing prices](https://github.com/wasifmkhan/Machine_Learning-Projects-Python/blob/main/Linear_Regression_ML_Boston_Housing_Work.ipynb).
2. [Logistic Regression Project to predict advertiser behaviour](https://github.com/wasifmkhan/Machine_Learning-Projects-Python/blob/main/Logistic%20Regression%20Project.ipynb)
3. [KNN - K nearest neighbour to predict a target class of anonymised data](https://github.com/wasifmkhan/Machine_Learning-Projects-Python/blob/main/KNN%20(K%20nearest%20neighbour)%20Project.ipynb)
4. [Random Forest & Decision Tree to predict whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full based on other features.](https://github.com/wasifmkhan/Machine_Learning-Projects-Python/blob/main/Random_Forest_Project.ipynb)
