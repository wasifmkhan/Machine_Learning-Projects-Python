# Various-ML-Projects
Here I will add machine learning projects and I do on the side in Python. Each file will have its own description.

1. Linear Regression to predict housing prices
2. Logistic Regression Project to predict advertiser behaviour
3. KNN - K nearest neighbour to predict a target class of anonymised data
4. Random Forest & Decision Tree to predict whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full based on other features.
